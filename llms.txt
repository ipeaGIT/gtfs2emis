**gtfs2emis** is an R package to estimate the emission levels of public
transport vehicles based on General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)
data. The package requires two main inputs: i) public transport data in
GTFS standard format; and ii) some basic information on fleet
characteristics such as vehicle age, technology, fuel, and Euro stage.
As it stands, the package estimates several pollutants (see table below)
at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Pollution levels can be
calculated for specific transport routes, trips, time of the day, or for
the transport system as a whole. The output with emission estimates can
be extracted in different formats, supporting analysis of how emission
levels vary across space, time, and by fleet characteristics. A full
description of the methods used in the gtfs2emis model is presented in
[Vieira, Pereira and Andrade
(2022)](https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/8m2cy).

## Installation

You can install `gtfs2emis`:

``` r
# From CRAN
install.packages("gtfs2emis")
library(gtfs2emis)

# or use the development version with latest features
utils::remove.packages('gtfs2emis')
devtools::install_github("ipeaGIT/gtfs2emis")
library(gtfs2emis)
```

## Usage and Data requirements

The `gtfs2emis` package has two core functions.

1.  [`transport_model()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/gtfs2emis/reference/transport_model.md)
    converts GTFS data into a GPS-like table with the space-time
    positions and speeds of public transport vehicles. The only input
    required is a `GTFS.zip` feed.

2.  [`emission_model()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/gtfs2emis/reference/emission_model.md)
    estimates hot-exhaust emissions based on four inputs:

- 1.  the result from the
      [`transport_model()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/gtfs2emis/reference/transport_model.md);
- 2.  a `data.frame` with info on fleet characteristics;
- 3.  a `string` indicating which emission factor model should be
      considered;
- 4.  a `string` indicating which pollutants should be estimated.

To help users analyze the output from
[`emission_model()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/gtfs2emis/reference/emission_model.md),
the `gtfs2emis` package has few functions:

3.  [`emis_to_dt()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/gtfs2emis/reference/emis_to_dt.md)
    to convert the output of
    [`emission_model()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/gtfs2emis/reference/emission_model.md)
    from `list` to `data.table`.
4.  [`emis_summary()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/gtfs2emis/reference/emis_summary.md)
    to aggregate emission estimates by the time of the day, vehicle
    type, or road segment.
5.  [`emis_grid()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/gtfs2emis/reference/emis_grid.md)
    to spatially aggregate emission estimates using any custom spatial
    grid or polygons.

## Demonstration on sample data

To illustrate functionality, the package includes small sample data sets
of the public transport and fleet of Curitiba (Brazil), Detroit (USA),
and Dublin (Ireland). Estimating the emissions of a given public
transport system using `gtfs2emis` can be done in three simple steps, as
follows.

### 1. Run transport model

The first step is to use the
[`transport_model()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/gtfs2emis/reference/transport_model.md)
function to convert GTFS data into a GPS-like table, so that we can get
the space-time position and speed of each vehicle of the public
transport system at high spatial and temporal resolutions.

``` r
# read GTFS.zip
gtfs_file <- system.file("extdata/irl_dub_gtfs.zip", package = "gtfs2emis")
gtfs <- gtfstools::read_gtfs(gtfs_file)

# generate transport model
tp_model <- transport_model(gtfs_data = gtfs,spatial_resolution = 100,parallel = TRUE) 
```

### 2. Prepare fleet data

The second step is to prepare a `data.frame` with some characteristics
of the public transport fleet. Note that different emission factor
models may require information on different fleet characteristics, such
as vehicle age, type, Euro standard, technology, and fuel. This can be
either: - A simple table with the overall composition of the fleet. In
this case, the `gtfs2emis` will assume that fleet is homogeneously
distributed across all routes; OR - A detailed table that (1) brings
info on the characteristics of each vehicle and, (2) tells the
probability with which each vehicle type is allocated to each transport
route.

Here is what a simple fleet table to be used with the EMEP-EEA emission
factor model looks like:

``` r
fleet_file <- system.file("extdata/irl_dub_fleet.txt", package = "gtfs2emis")

fleet_df <- read.csv(fleet_file)
fleet_df
#>             veh_type euro fuel   N fleet_composition    tech
#> 1 Ubus Std 15 - 18 t  III    D  10        0.00998004       -
#> 2 Ubus Std 15 - 18 t   IV    D 296        0.29540918     SCR
#> 3 Ubus Std 15 - 18 t    V    D 148        0.14770459     SCR
#> 4 Ubus Std 15 - 18 t   VI    D 548        0.54690619 DPF+SCR
```

### 3. Run emission model

In the final step, the
[`emission_model()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/gtfs2emis/reference/emission_model.md)
function to estimate hot exhaust emissions of our public transport
system. Here, the user needs to pass the results from
[`transport_model()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/gtfs2emis/reference/transport_model.md),
some fleet data as described above, and select which emission factor
model and pollutants should be considered (see the options available
below). The output from
[`emission_model()`](https://ipeagit.github.io/gtfs2emis/reference/emission_model.md)
is a `list` with several `vectors` and `data.frames` with emission
estimates and related information such as vehicle variables (`fuel`,
`age`, `tech`, `euro`, `fleet_composition`), travel variables (`slope`,
`load`, `gps`) or pollution (`EF`, `emi`).

``` r
emi_list <- emission_model(tp_model = tp_model
, ef_model = "ef_europe_emep"
, fleet_data = fleet_df
, pollutant = c("NOx","PM10")
)

names(emi_list)
#>  [1] "pollutant"         "veh_type"          "euro"             
#>  [4] "fuel"              "tech"              "slope"            
#>  [7] "load"              "speed"             "EF"               
#> [10] "emi"               "fleet_composition" "tp_model"
```

### Emissions from road vehicle tire, brake, and surface wear

`gtfs2emis` also provides emissions estimates from tire, brake and
surface wear using the [EMEP/EEA
model](https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/air/air-pollution-sources-1/emep-eea-air-pollutant-emission-inventory-guidebook/emep).
The function estimates emissions of particulate matter (PM),
encompassing black carbon (BC), which arises from distinct sources
(tire, brake, and road surface wear). The focus is on primary particles,
which refer to those that are directly emitted, rather than those
generated from the re-suspension of previously deposited material.
