**gtfs2emis** is an R package to estimate the emission levels of public
transport vehicles based on General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS)
data. The package requires two main inputs: i) public transport data in
GTFS standard format; and ii) some basic information on fleet
characteristics such as vehicle age, technology, fuel and Euro stage. As
it stands, the the package estimates several pollutants (see table
below) at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Pollution levels can be
calculated for specific transport routes, trips, time of the day or for
the transport system as a whole. The output with emission estimates can
be extracted in different formats, supporting analysis on how emission
levels vary across space, time and by fleet characteristics.

<!-- The **gtfs2emis** package leverages on standard GTFS data format and develops a computational method that can be easily used to estimate enviromental emissions of several public transport systems around the world. One of the core advantages of **gtfs2emis** is that it makes extremely easy to simulate how the environmental performance of a public transport system would change under different policy scenarios. Simple modifications to the package input would allow one to estimate how emissions levels could be affected by different interventions such as electrifying the fleet, building new transport corridors, changing route itineraries or frequencies and fleet renewal. -->

### Installation

`gtfs2emis` will soon be on CRAN. In the meantime, you can install the
dev version from Github:

``` r
devtools::install_github("ipeaGIT/gtfs2emis")
library(gtfs2emis)
```

## Usage and Data requirements

The `gtfs2emis` package has two core functions.

1.  `transport_model()` converts GTFS data into a GPS-like table with
    the space-time positions and speeds of public transport vehicles.
    The only input required is a `GTFS.zip` feed.

2.  `emission_model()` estimates hot-exhaust emissions based on four
    inputs:

-   1)  the result from the `transport_model()`;

-   2)  a `data.frame` with info on fleet characteristics;

-   3)  a `string` indicating which emission factor model should be
        considered;

-   4)  a `string` indicating which pollutants should be estimated.

To help users analyze the output from `emission_model()`, the
`gtfs2emis` package has few functions:

3.  `emis_to_dt()` to convert the output of `emission_model()` from
    `list` to `data.table`.
4.  `emis_summary()` to aggregate emission estimates by time of the day,
    vehicle type or road segment.
5.  `emis_grid()` to spatially aggregate emission estimates using any
    custom spatial grid or polygons.

## Demonstration on sample data

To illustrate functionality, the package includes small sample data sets
of the public transport and fleet of Curitiba (Brazil), Detroit (USA)
and Dublin (Ireland). Estimating the emissions of a given public
transport system using `gtfs2emis` can be done three simple steps, as
follows.

### 1. Run transport model

The first step is to use the `transport_model()` function to convert
GTFS data into a GPS-like table, so that we can get the space-time
position and speed of each vehicle of the public transport system at
high spatial and temporal resolutions.

``` r
# read GTFS.zip
gtfs_file <- system.file("extdata/irl_dub_gtfs.zip", package = "gtfs2emis")
gtfs <- gtfstools::read_gtfs(gtfs_file)

# generate transport model
tp_model <- transport_model(gtfs_data = gtfs,spatial_resolution = 100,parallel = TRUE) 
```

### 2. Prepare fleet data

The second step is to prepare a `data.frame` with some characteristics
of the public transport fleet. Note that different emission factor
models may require information on different fleet characteristics, such
as vehicle age, type, Euro standard, technology and fuel. This can be
either: - A simple table with the overall composition of the fleet. In
this case, the `gtfs2emis` will assume that fleet is homogeneously
distributed across all routes; OR - A detailed table that (1) brings
info on the characteristics of each individual vehicle and, (2) tells
the probability with which each vehicle type is allocated to each
transport route.

Here is how a simple fleet table to be used with the EMEP-EEA emission
factor model looks like:

``` r
fleet_file <- system.file("extdata/irl_dub_fleet.txt", package = "gtfs2emis")

fleet_df <- read.csv(fleet_file)
fleet_df
#>             veh_type euro fuel   N fleet_composition    tech
#> 1 Ubus Std 15 - 18 t  III    D  10        0.00998004       -
#> 2 Ubus Std 15 - 18 t   IV    D 296        0.29540918     SCR
#> 3 Ubus Std 15 - 18 t    V    D 148        0.14770459     SCR
#> 4 Ubus Std 15 - 18 t   VI    D 548        0.54690619 DPF+SCR
```

### 3. Run emission model

In the final step, the `emission_model()` function to estimate hot
exhaust emissions of our public transport system. Here, the user needs
to pass the results from `transport_model()`, some fleet data as
described above, and select which emission factor model and pollutants
should be considered (see the options available below). The output from
`emission_model()` is a `list` with several `vectors` and `data.frames`
with emission estimates and related information such as vehicle
variables (`fuel`, `age`, `tech`, `euro`, `fleet_composition`), travel
variables (`slope`, `load`, `gps`) or pollution (`EF`, `emi`).

``` r
emi_list <- emission_model(tp_model = tp_model
, ef_model = "ef_europe_emep"
, fleet_data = fleet_df
, pollutant = c("NOx","PM10")
)

names(emi_list)
#>  [1] "pollutant"         "veh_type"          "euro"             
#>  [4] "fuel"              "tech"              "slope"            
#>  [7] "load"              "speed"             "EF"               
#> [10] "emi"               "fleet_composition" "tp_model"
```
