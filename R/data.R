#' Emission factors from European Environment Agency — EMEP/EEA
#'
#' Hot exhaust emission factors are speed dependent functions and are expressed in g/km. 
#' They differ by fuel, vehicle segment, euro standard, pollutant, and after treatment technology. 
#' Several functions are consolidated into equations, given by
#'
#' EF = EF(Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Zita, Hta, RF, Speed, Function_ID, k, fcorr),
#' 
#' where Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Zeta, Eta are constant parameters; 
#' RF is the Reduction Factor, Speed in the average speed, Function_ID is the 
#' formula that depends on the year of the inventory and the pollutant; k is 
#' a constant value, fcorr is the fuel correction factor.
#' 
#' The emissions factors are derived from the EMEP/EEA air pollutant emission inventory guidebook
#' (formerly called the EMEP CORINAIR emission inventory guidebook). The guide provides guidance on
#' estimating emissions from both anthropogenic and natural emission sources. 
#' 
#' The package presents a combination of emission factors from EMEP/EEA guidelines of 2007,
#'  2013, 2016, and 2019, aiming to cover a greater number of pollutants and vehicle segments.
#'  The script used to organize the EMEP/EEA databases can be found in the repository
#'  <<https://github.com/ipeaGIT/gtfs2emis/blob/master/data-raw/ef_europe_emep_db.R>>.

#' Emission factors from California Air Resources Board (EMFAC Model)
#' 
#' Running exhaust emissions factors from EMFAC2017 model. The model considers
#' emission factors (EF) of urban buses in California (United States), considering 
#' different pollutants, years of reference, model year, fuel, speed ranges,
#' type of regions, model version, and type of season. The gtfs2emis package 
#' currently supports EF only for "Statewide" region type, and "Annual" season. 
#' Specific data of these variables can be download at <<https://arb.ca.gov/emfac/emissions-inventory>>.
